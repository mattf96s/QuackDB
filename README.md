# QuackDB - _Online DuckDB SQL Playground (WIP)_

[![Seed Status](https://api.seed.run/quackdb/QuackDB/stages/prod/build_badge)](https://console.seed.run/quackdb/QuackDB)

QuackDB is a privacy-preserving in-browser DuckDB SQL playground and editor. Demo available at [app.quackdb.com](https://app.quackdb.com).

- **In-Browser**: The DuckDB Wasm library is used to run SQL queries in the browser.
- **File Types**: Supports `.csv`, `.json`, `.parquet`, `.sqlite`, `.duckdb` and `.arrow` files.
- **Privacy**: no screen recordings or client-side error monitoring. Fathom Analytics is used for basic page view tracking and Sentry runs server-side only (without session tracking).
- **Filesystem Access**: OPFS is used to store files in the browser's filesystem for persistence.

There is no screen recordings or client-side error monitoring‚Äîso let me know about any errors üòú. The only tracking is basic page views using Fathom Analytics.

Note: This project is a work in progress.

## Motivation

I wanted a quick and simple tool for iterating on DuckDB queries and visualizing the results. I also wanted to experiment with the new Filesystem Access API (OPFS) and explore the capabilities of DuckDB in the browser.

## Tips

- Built in chrome OPFS viewer can be accessed from <https://app.quackdb.com/temporary>. To navigate, manually change the URL to the desired path as Chrome does not allow navigation by clicking on the links.

## Known Issues

- Safari will not be fully supported until this [bug](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=256712#c0) is fixed (serializing file handles is not supported in Safari).
